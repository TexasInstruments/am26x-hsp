Design models in Simulink, generate code using Embedded Coder, and run the executables on AM263x, AM263Px, AM261x hardware platforms designed for real-time control applications without using manual programming. Apply industry-proven techniques for Model-Based Design to verify that the algorithms work during simulation and then implement the algorithms as standalone applications on the AM26X platforms using automatic code generation. By default, the generated code is ANSI/ISO C/C++.

Embedded Coder Support Package for Texas Instruments AM26X Processors supports:

- Library of Simulink blocks that connect to AM263x, AM263Px, AM261x I/O such as ADC, DAC, CMPSS, EPWM, ECAP, EQEP, SDFM, GPIO, UART, MCAN, SPI, HWI
- Rapid prototyping of algorithms on-chip using automated build, deploy and execution
- Built-in support for specific hardware (ControlCards and LaunchPads), scheduler (baremetal scheduler), FreeRTOS and compiler
- Processor-in-the-loop PIL support
- Real-time parameter tuning and logging using External mode (XCP over Serial, XCP over CAN)

Supported hardware:
- controlCard: AM263x, AM263Px
- LaunchPad: AM263x, AM263Px, AM261x
- Custom boards: AM263x based, AM263Px based

#### Download the HSP package:

Method 1:

- Step 1. Open MATLAB
- Step 2. Click Add-Ons -> Get Hardware Support Packages
- Step 3. In the Add-On Explorer window, use 'Search for add-ons' field to search for 'AM26x'
- Step 4. From the dropdown, choose 'Embedded Coder Support Hardware Support Package for TI AM26x'
- Step 5. Expect the page for the add-on to open
- Step 6. Click Add -> Download Only. Do not use Add -> Add to MATLAB (Download and add to path)
- Step 7. Sign In  using MathWorks Account when prompted
- Step 8. Download the zip file

Method 2:

- Step 1. In your browser, browse to link: https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/174295-embedded-coder-hardware-support-package-for-ti-am26x
- Step 2. Click Download
- Step 3. Sign In using MathWorks Account
- Step 4. Download the zip file

#### Install the HSP package:

- Step 1. Open MATLAB
- Step 2. Ensure to set 'Preferences'->'MATLAB'->'Add-Ons'->'Installation Folder' to a path with no spaces. For example: C:\workarea\AddOns
- Step 3. Extract the zip file to the installation folder. For example: C:\workarea\AddOns\am26x-hsp-xxxxxxx
- Step 4. In the MATLAB environment, browse to the installed folder. For example: C:\workarea\AddOns\am26x-hsp-xxxxxxx folder
